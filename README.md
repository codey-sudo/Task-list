Code pattern: MVC 

Model: 
Contains all the code that saves and manages data


View:
Contains all the code that manages visuals. Renders visuals using data in the model.


Controller:
Connects model and view together;
1. Responds to events from the view (e.g. button clicks)
2. Tells the model to update its data (and the view to re-render)


MVC allows each section to do only 1 thing.

Common pattern in webdev.
You can build more impressive and larger projects.
most javascript frameworks are built on MVC architecture

A framework provides common functions, methods and objects for rendering visuals and managing data.


If you need to add features like a 'save' feature, you know it would have to go into your MODEL section of your code.
